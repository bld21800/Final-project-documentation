# Final Project Documentation

### Project Details 
This project was somewhat a challenge and somewhat easy. My goal was to create an rc car that can go around a water bottle. 
AT first I did not think I could complete this task because it seemed hard and I did not want to spend tons of money. I began to research on what to do.
I found alot of videos on doing this process. This made it easier for me to get this done.


### Struggles
At first I had a hard time finding a project idea.
I had to watch alot of videos and see a lot of websites.
Finding the right screws was troublesome.
I had to use tape instead of screws for some parts.

### Didn't expect
I did not expect to find the parts I needed in the class room.
I expected to get stuck at the wiring portion of this project but I got to the end to get this car to move.

### Materials
-Arduino/ makeblock orion
-Battery source
-Set of wheels with motors
-Wires that attach the motors to the Arduino/ makeblock orion
-Makeblock app to add code


### Steps
1. I found all the parts I needed within the class room.
2. I was able to put all the parts together using screws and in some instances tape.
3. Once all parts were connected I had to begin writing code for the car.
4. I had to download makeblock to write the code.
4. Once the code was written i connected the laptop to the car and transfer the code so the car can move.
5. The car is now able to move.



### Outcome 
I was able to reach my goal
